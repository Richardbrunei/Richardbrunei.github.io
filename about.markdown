## About me
<img src="Richardbrunei/Richardbrunei.github.io/blob/main/assets/mesnow.JPG" alt="Me snowboading">

Hello, I'm Richard Zou. I know C++, Python, and HTML. I use C++ for competetive coding contests like USACO and Codeforces. I used python to make games with pygame. I am currently living in the U.S and I'm in Grade 9. I used to live in Brunei and Australia. I am currently silver in USACO. Other than coding, I enjoy playing squash.
