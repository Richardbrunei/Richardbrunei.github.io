I have finished setting up and creating this website. I used the theme Not Pure Poole for this website. The list of blog posts is the home page of the website, but I want to change it to the about page. I tried switching the layouts of the home page, but it didn't work. I changed some of the fonts and colors in the CSS successfully.
